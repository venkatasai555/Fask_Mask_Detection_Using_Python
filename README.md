# Fask_Mask_Detection_Using_Python

Welcome to the Face Mask Detection Project completed during my internship at CodeClause. This project showcases the successful development of an automated system capable of detecting whether an individual is wearing a face mask. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, this project holds significant value in promoting public health and safety through mask-wearing compliance.

Project Highlights
This project encompasses a range of crucial features aimed at achieving accurate and real-time face mask detection:

Data Collection: A diverse and carefully curated dataset was collected, containing a wide variety of images and videos depicting individuals with and without face masks. This dataset covered different scenarios, lighting conditions, and perspectives, ensuring the model's robustness.

Model Development: The core of the project involved developing a robust machine learning model. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to create a model capable of accurately classifying whether a person is wearing a face mask. The architecture was trained on labeled data, enabling it to make informed predictions.

Real-time Detection: Once the model was trained, it was deployed for real-time face mask detection. This implementation allowed the system to process live video streams and images captured by cameras, making it a valuable tool for various environments.

Post-processing and Alerting: To ensure the reliability of the system, post-processing techniques were employed to minimize false positives and false negatives. The system also generated alerts or notifications for mask violations, making it an effective solution for promoting compliance.

Workflow Overview
The project followed a structured workflow:

Data Preprocessing: The collected data was meticulously cleaned and normalized to enhance the model's performance during training.

Face Detection: Advanced face detection algorithms were utilized to pinpoint and extract facial regions of interest within the images or video frames.

Model Training and Validation: The model was trained on preprocessed face images, and its performance was rigorously evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Deployment and Real-time Detection: The trained model was deployed for real-time detection, and techniques like frame differencing were applied to improve its accuracy.

Alerting Mechanism: Post-processing steps were employed to fine-tune the model's predictions, and alerts were generated when mask violations were detected.
